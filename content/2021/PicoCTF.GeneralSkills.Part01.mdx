I have always been interested in(and enjoyed) the challenge that coding challenges bring, such as [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) and [](). I have also been increasingly interested in penetration testing and that area of computer science, so I have slowly been hearing more and more about CTFs(`C`apture `T`he `F`lags). I have worked on the `Bandit` series of wargames from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).
I have recently been exposed to a new one for me, [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) from a few of [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw)'s youtube videos.
For this article, I am going through the [first page of the challenges under the `General Skills` tag.](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=5&page=1) 


## Obedient Cat
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka `"in-the-clear"`).[***Download flag***](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag).

### Writeup:
Download the file and `cat` the file:
```shell-session
$ cat flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_b5aeb3dd}
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_b5aeb3dd}`


## Python Wrangling
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run [this Python script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/ende.py) using [this password](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/pw.txt) to get [the flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/flag.txt.en)?

### Writeup:
In this one, we start out provided with three files
```shell-session
$ ls
ende.py  flag.txt.en  pw.txt
```
**`pw.txt`** = Text file with the password in it. -> `aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16`</br>
**`flag.txt.en`** = Text file that holds the encrypted flag. -> `gAAAAABgUAIWjVP_Ne1VPrHlLZKpvfaifN7qlLoN7NEzOpAl55av7sPuV8wQZj9V-6oI_x4L10O8R-b9c19INaTFrlGbT6YxQeLXd2S3FQA8HmFxU9NILpJGEtVPsGpzPAmLSsRwezRX` </br>
**`ende.py`** = Python script that we are told to use with the password to decrypt the flag.

We can copy the password for later, and try running `ende.py`:
```shell-session
$ python3 ende.py
Usage: ende.py (-e/-d) [file]
```
Looks like we just need to add either `-e or -d`, (we will add `-d` because we are `decrypting`), we also need to substitute our `flag.txt.en` in as `[file]`.
```shell-session
$ python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en
Please enter the password:aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_aa821c16}
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_aa821c16}`


## Wave a flag
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [**This program**](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a14be2648c73e3cda5fc8490a2f476af/warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

### Writeup:
To start, we have to make the `warm` file `executable`.
```shell-session
$ chmod +x warm
```
Let's try to run it now?
```shell-session
$ ./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
```
All right then, let's pass the `-h` flag to it to get the help message.
```shell-session
$ ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}
```
There it is!

### Flag:
`picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}`


## Nice netcat...
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239`, but it doesn't speak English...

### Writeup:
When we enter 
```shell-session
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239
```
We get weird output as numbers printed out on many lines.
```shell-session
112 
105 
99 
111 
67 
84 
70 
123 
103 
48 
48 
100 
95 
107 
49 
116 
116 
121 
33 
95 
110 
49 
99 
51 
95 
107 
49 
116 
116 
121 
33 
95 
55 
99 
48 
56 
50 
49 
102 
53 
125 
10
```
We can save that into an output file with:
```shell-session
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 > netcat_output.txt
```
Now that we have saved those numbers for later, let's write a python script to translate the ASCII coded numbers into Unicode.
```python
ascii_to_unicode = []
with open('netcat_output.txt', 'r') as f:
   for line in f.readlines():
      ascii_to_unicode.append(chr(int(line)))
   print(''.join(ascii_to_unicode))
```
**`On Line 1`**, we get an empty list ready to add each translated ASCII coded number to. </br>
**`On Line 2`**, with the output file(`netcat_output.txt`) open it for reading, refer to it as `'f'`. </br>
**`Then On Line 3`**, we check each line in all the lines of the output file and for each of those lines.</br>
**`Line 4`**, we make sure python recognizes it as an integer instead of a string with `int()`, then we check that integer's Unicode equivalent with `chr()`, and finally, with that value, we append it to our list at the beginning.</br>
**`Finally, On Line 5`**, we print the whole list after we turn it into a string, which is our flag.

### Flag:
`picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}`


## Static ain't always noise
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
Can you look at the data in this binary: [static](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/bc72945175d643626d6ea9a689672dbd/static)? This [BASH script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/bc72945175d643626d6ea9a689672dbd/ltdis.sh) might help!

### Writeup:
For this one I just ran
```shell-session
$ strings static | grep "pico"
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_1e6a7731}`


## Tab, Tab, Attack
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: [Addadshashanammu.zip](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/659efd595171e4c40378be6a2e9b7298/Addadshashanammu.zip) 

### Writeup:
With the given zip file, run: 
```shell-session
$ unzip Addadshashanammu.zip
Archive:  Addadshashanammu.zip
   creating: Addadshashanammu/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/
  inflating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/fang-of-haynekhtnamet  
``` 
That gives us the folder structure within the zip file.
On the completion of `unzip`, it prints what folders and files were created and inflated. We get a lengthy descent of 7 folders deep and 1 file at the end. I just copy/pasted the path to the file and ran: 
```shell-session
$ strings Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/fang-of-haynekhtnamet | grep "pico"
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_524e3dc4}`


## Magikarp Ground Mission
*AUTHOR: SYREAL*
### Description:
Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6d448c9c`

### Writeup:
To get started, we have to Launch Instance. Once up, we use the provided ssh command below the Description.
For me this time it is: 

```shell-session
$ ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 53053
```

It asks if you're sure you want to continue, type `yes` and hit your `Enter` key.
It will then ask you for the password, use the password they gave, `6d448c9c`.

After that, let's run `ls` like they tell us to.

```shell-session 
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
```
With both of those text files, let's see what is inside of them.

```shell-session
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat *
picoCTF{xxsh_
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
```
Looks like we have 1/3 of the flag, let's follow the instructions they give us.

```shell-session
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ..
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  boot  etc   instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin          dev   home  lib             media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```
There is the second piece! Let's get it and add it to our first piece, while we're at it, let's read the instructions to the final piece of the flag.

```shell-session
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt instructions-to-3of3.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
```

Almost there! Let's navigate to `~`:

```shell-session
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
```

There's the final piece! Let's get it!

```shell-session
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
5190b070}
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_5190b070}`


## Lets Warm Up
*AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS*
### Description:
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

### Writeup:
Using the Python Interpreter, we can easily see the given hexadecimal number in Unicode by just inputting the number and pressing Enter: 
```python
>>> 0x70
112
``` 

Next, we can use python's `chr()` method, which returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is an integer.

```python
>>> chr(0x70)
'p'
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{p}`


## Warmed Up
*AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS*
### Description:
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

### Writeup:
Using the technically unnecessary first step in `*Lets Warm Up*`, we can again simply enter the hexadecimal number into the Python Interpreter:
```python
>>> 0x3D
61
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{61}`


## 2Warm
*AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS*
### Description:
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

### Writeup:
In the Python Interpreter, we can use the `bin()` method, `which converts and returns the binary equivalent string of a given integer.`
```python
>>> bin(42)
'0b101010'
```

For the flag, we should take off the `0b` part, which is just used by the computer to differentiate binary numbers from numbers in base 10 representation.

### Flag:
`picoCTF{101010}`


## what's a net cat?
*AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS*
### Description:
Using netcat(nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org` at port `64287` to get the flag?

### Writeup:
We simply follow the instructions they give us, and they do give us the flag. Let's `netcat` that `domain` on that `port`.
```shell-session
$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
```

### Flag:
`picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}`


## strings it
*AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS*
### Description:
Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/5bd86036f013ac3b9c958499adf3e2e2/strings) without running it?

### Writeup:
After downloading the file, using the hint of the challenge's title 'strings it', run the `strings` command with a grep to filter for the pico flag
`strings strings | grep "pico"`

### Flag:
`picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_827aee91}`
