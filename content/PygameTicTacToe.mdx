## Making A TicTacToe Game In Python With Pygame

I have been wanting to find a project that would be new for me, so I could refresh my motivation in coding with it. I wanted to learn more about the python module, Pygame. So I decided to try to implement a program I have explored in the past, TicTacToe.

### Here's What It Looks Like

> ***The Red and Blue are the chosen places for each player, and the green is the box that is being hovered over.***

I started with some basic setup, initializing pygame, setting the width and height of the game display, and setting the window caption:
~~~~python
pygame.init()
displayWidth, displayHeight = 685, 780
gameDisplay = pygame.display.set_mode((displayWidth, displayHeight))
pygame.display.set_caption('Tic-Tac-Toe')
~~~~

I then continued with setting some colors with RGB to use in-game, configure the size of the spaces in the tictactoe board, and I built the game board with a nested for loop:
~~~~python
board = []
for y in (100, 101 + tileSize, 102 + (tileSize*2)): 
	for x in (4, 5 + tileSize, 6 + (tileSize*2)):
		box = pygame.Rect(x, y, tileSize, tileSize)
		board.append(box) # place each box in the board	
~~~~

> ***The incrementation of 1 to each element in the for loops is to allow for a 1 pixel gap between the boxes.***

## Main Function
Inside of the Main Game Function, I made the main loop variable 'GameRunning' set to True. On initial startup the 'gameOver' variable is set to False. The current player is tracked with the variable 'currentPlayer' set to 'x'. Then, with that 'currentPlayer' variable, I render the message that will tell whose turn it is. Finally, before starting the game loop, I set a variable to keep track of the chosen spaces during the game, the spaces will be updated from a value of 'None', to 'x' or 'o' accordingly.
~~~~python
# ----------- Main Game Function ---------------
def runGame():
	# Game Variables
	gameRunning = True
	gameOver = False

	letter = font.render('X', True, white)

	currentPlayer = 'x' # The Turn of the Current Player
	turnMessage = font.render(f'{currentPlayer.upper()} Turn', True, black)

	trackBoard = [None for i in range(0, 9)] # Board to keep track of X's and O's

# ------------- Start Of Game Loop ----------------
	while gameRunning:
~~~~


Within the game loop, I have a Game Over Menu loop that runs if the 'gameOver' variable is 'True'. It runs my 'blitMultiLineText()' function(Found below) because the game over message is a little bit long for the size of the window. I then go into the game over event handling loop which either quits or continues.
~~~~python
# ----------- Game Over Menu -------------
		while gameOver == True:
			gameDisplay.fill(white)
			blitMultiLineText(gameDisplay, gameOverMessage, (20, 20), font, color=red)
			pygame.display.update()
			for event in pygame.event.get():
				if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
					gameOver = False
					gameRunning = False
				if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
					if event.key == ord('q'):
						gameRunning = False
						gameOver = False
						pygame.quit()
					if event.key == pygame.K_c:
						runGame()
~~~~

After the game over menu, I get into the handling for the gameplay. First, I check if there is a quit request, then I check for any clicks on any of the boxes on the board. If there was a click on a box, I log the current player on the 'trackBoard' list in whichever box was clicked, then I switch the 'currentPlayer', update the 'turnMessage' with the new 'currentPlayer', and check for a game over.
~~~~python
# ------------- Gameplay Handling ----------------
		for event in pygame.event.get(): # If the exit button was clicked, exit the game
			if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
				gameRunning = False
			if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
				for box in board: 								 # If the mouse was clicked
					if box.collidepoint(pygame.mouse.get_pos()) and spaceIsAvailable(box, trackBoard): # Check if it was in a box on the board and if the box is available or not
						trackBoard[board.index(box)] = currentPlayer 	 # Make the board reflect the current player's choice
						currentPlayer = switchTurn(currentPlayer)
						turnMessage = font.render(f'{currentPlayer.upper()} Turn', True, black) # Re-render the turnMessage
						gameOver = isGameOver(trackBoard)
~~~~

The last chunk of the main game function is the game code, which consists of drawing/blitting the different things for the game window. Refreshing the screen with white, blitting the scores of 'X' and 'O' in the top left and right corners respectively, and blitting the message that displays whose turn it is. Then checking the 'trackBoard' list to display the boxes as red if player 'X' chose them already, display them blue if player 'O' has chosen them already, or display them as green when the mouse is hovering over one of the unchosen boxes. Otherwise, display them as the basic, unselected, black box.
~~~~python
# ----------- Game Code -------------------
		# Refresh the screen with white
		gameDisplay.fill(white)

		# Display the scores of each player
		gameDisplay.blit(scores.xScoreMessage, (0, 10))
		gameDisplay.blit(scores.oScoreMessage, (500, 10))

		# Display whose turn it is
		gameDisplay.blit(turnMessage, (230, 10))

		# Draw The Current Gameboard
		for box in board:
			if trackBoard[board.index(box)] == 'x': # if x has previously selected a box, display red
				pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, red, box)
			elif trackBoard[board.index(box)] == 'o': # if o has previously selected a box, display blue
				pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, blue, box)
			elif box.collidepoint(pygame.mouse.get_pos()): # if the box is being hovered over, display green
				pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, green, box)
			else: 										  # if nothing is/has happened to the box, display black
				pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, black, box)

		pygame.display.update()
~~~~

## Custom Defined Functions and Class

### Scores Class
To handle the scores and make them persistant through each game over, I made a class called 'Scores', I initialize it in the variable 'scores' before the main game function so that after pressing 'c' at the gameover screen, the scores are not reset on the rerun of 'runGame()'.
Inside the init function of the class, I set the scores of x and o equal to 0, and I render their score messages to be blitted to the top corners of the display.
I then have a simple 'scoreUpdate()' function that takes the argument of the 'currentPlayer' then updates and rerenders the score of that player.

### Switching Turns
A simple function that takes the 'currentPlayer', and switches to whoever isn't the 'currentPlayer'.
~~~~python
def switchTurn(currentPlayer):
	if currentPlayer == 'x':
		return 'o'
	else:
		return 'x'
~~~~

### Check Availability Of Clicked
Another simple function that takes in the box that is selected and the current 'trackBoard'. It checks the index of that box in the 'trackBoard' and if it is 'None' then it returns 'True' that the box is available.
~~~~python
def spaceIsAvailable(box, trackBoard):
	if trackBoard[board.index(box)] == None:
		return True
	else:
		return False
~~~~

### Check For Gameover 
This function takes the current board as an argument and checks all the possible three in a row combinations(The three horizontal rows, the three vertical columns, and the two diagonals) to see if either player has won. If there is a winner, return 'True', if there is no winner yet, return 'False'.


### Multiple Line Blitting Function
In this function, I take the necessary arguments for rendering text and blitting in pygame, the surface to blit to, the text to be written, the position to place the multi-line text, the chosen pygame.font, and the color of the text defaulted to black.
The words are then 
~~~~python
def blitMultiLineText(surface, text, position, font, color=pygame.Color('black')):
    words = [word.split(' ') for word in text.splitlines()]  # 2D array where each row is a list of words.
    space = font.size(' ')[0]  # The width of a space.
    maxWidth, maxHeight = surface.get_size()
    x, y = position
    for line in words:
        for word in line:
            wordSurface = font.render(word, 0, color)
            wordWidth, wordHeight = wordSurface.get_size()
            if x + wordWidth >= maxWidth:
                x = position[0]  # Reset the x.
                y += wordHeight  # Start on new row.
            surface.blit(wordSurface, (x, y))
            x += wordWidth + space
        x = position[0]  # Reset the x.
        y += wordHeight  # Start on new row.
~~~~

## Conclusion
I had a good time learning how to draw all the things to the pygame window. I learned how to make hover effects on buttons, and I learned how to organize my code better for pygame and even any other projects. 
In the future I would love to add in a few options, maybe a local game mode, an online game mode using python's sockets module, and making a single player option where the 'O' player is controlled by a recursive algorithm to choose where to play.
